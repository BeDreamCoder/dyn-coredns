CoreDNS is a DNS server/forwarder, written in Go, that chains [plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins).
Each plugin performs a (DNS) function.

CoreDNS is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) graduated project.

CoreDNS is a fast and flexible DNS server. The key word here is *flexible*: with CoreDNS you
are able to do what you want with your DNS data by utilizing plugins. If some functionality is not
provided out of the box you can add it by [writing a plugin](https://coredns.io/explugins).
